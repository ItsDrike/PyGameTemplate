# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for the contributors to this project. We are committed to providing a
welcoming and inspiring project that anyone can easily join, and expect this code of conduct to be honored by core
developers, contributors, and newcomers.

## Our goal

We want to ensure that our project remains easy to contribute to and well documented which makes it easy for everyone
to improve the code base or add something new to it. We also want to ensure that this project will always stay
open-sourced and all of it's derivative works will also remain in the public space, where they can be read and modified
by anyone. This is enforced through our GPL v3 license, however that license may not be the easiest to read through and
understand.

## Attribution

We encourage an open-source work ethic, and we try solve our issues collaboratively. The difference between properly
attributed work and plagiarized submissions is found in citing source material and permission of the original author.
We have a special document in the root directory of our project purely for mentioning giving proper attributions to any
code that wasn't written by you specifically.

Proper attribution includes mentioning the file(s) which were taken in the LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY along with a full copy
of the license text (If the license is already there, you can only add the copyright head, don't re-add the same
license text so that we can keep everything clean and organized). When you're using code from another project, make
sure that their license is permissive and allows relicensing or is compatible with our GPL v3 license.

Please note: an online code repository that has no license is presumed to be source-available, but not open sourced
this means that the only the copyright holder has the rights to use it and should not be used in this code base. A
license is the only way to lift some restrictions of pure copyright which you gain immediately after you've wrote some
code. All unlicensed code is fully protected by this copyright which means that it can't be re-used in any way, even if
it is publicly available. If you have some projects without a license, please always make sure to add one so that your
project can actually be considered open-sourced and others can benefit from it as can you from the projects of others.
Don't be a leach by utilizing open-sourced code without giving back to the community.

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the re-use of someone else's work (eg: any code, binary content such as images, textual content such as
an article, etc.) without the permission or license right from the author. Claiming someone else's work as your own is
disrespectful to the author and to your own learning process.

Attempting to add plagiarized content to our code-base will result in us immediately removing that content and you
likely being banned from ever contributing to our project again. Not to mention that doing this is illegal in most
countries and could lead to lawsuits being filed against you by the true owners of the stolen material. We take
plagiarism very seriously ad it is important that you always give credit where credit is due.

## Harassment

We share a common understanding of what constitutes harassment, as it applies to a professional setting. Although this
list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin,
political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, disability and personal
appearance. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including some
that may not have bee mentioned here. Discrimination of any kind is completely unacceptable and immoral.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments (or "jokes") related to any of the above mentioned attributes.
- Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their explicit consent, except as necessary to
  protect others from intentional abuse.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health,
  parenting, drugs and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering. This includes deadnaming or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a
  person's gender identity. You must address people by the name they give you when not addressing them by their
  username or handle.
- Threats of violence, both physical and psychological.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to engage in self-harm.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication
- Pattern of inappropriate social conduct, such as requesting-assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others, or
  excessive teasing after a request to stop.
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Sabotage of someone else's work or intentionally hindering someone else's performance.

We seek to treat everyone as fairly and equitably as possible. Our community is open to anyone joining our project and
helping out in any way without being discriminated or otherwise harassed. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we
expect them to take responsibility for their actions. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility
to listen carefully and respectfully, and to do our best to right the wrong.

If you have experienced or witnessed unacceptable behavior constituting a code of conduct violation or have any other
code of conduct concerns, please let us know and we will do our best to resolve this issue.

## Sources

The open-source community has an incredible amount of resources that people have offered to others free of charge and
we all depend on many of these sources. This code of conduct article is no exception and there were many open source
projects that has helped bring this code of conduct to existence. For that reason, we'd like to thank all of these
communities and projects for keeping their content open and available to everyone, but most notably we'd like to thank
the projects with established codes of conduct and diversity statements that we used as our inspiration. Below is the
list these projects:
